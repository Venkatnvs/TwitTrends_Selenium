## API Workflow 🌐  

1. **Frontend**:  
   - Accepts a Twitter username and password via a form.  
   - Sends this data as a POST request to the backend (`/run-script`).  
   - Displays the fetched trends dynamically in a styled format.  

2. **Backend**:  
   - Receives the user credentials and validates them.  
   - Fetches top 5 trending topics (mocked or real Twitter API integration).  
   - Returns a JSON response containing trends, query datetime, and IP address.  

3. **Output**:  
   - Only displays non-null trends dynamically.
